DATA SCIENCE: MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES

Machine learning is behind the biggest innovations in artificial intelligence — so much so that AI and machine learning have become nearly synonymous. In this course, we’ll focus on machine learning techniques for supervised and unsupervised learning problems, including deep learning. You’ll learn how to select and tune machine learning algorithms based on use cases. You'll also understand the pros and cons of different algorithms and how to open up “black box” models. We’ll finish by looking at how models are deployed in production.
